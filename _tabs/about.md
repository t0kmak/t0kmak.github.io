## Hi, I'm Alem :D

I'm a **Computer Science graduate** with a strong interest in **cybersecurity**.  
My journey began a couple of years ago when I attended my first cybersecurity workshop. There, I was introduced to the basics of modern security threats and the fundamental defenses against them.

One of the first challenges I faced was the lack of guidance from experienced professionals in the field. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands.  
I began learning the basics of **penetration testing** through platforms like [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/), [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/), and many others.

Thanks to my curiosity and persistence, I started competing in **CTF challenges** at my university â€” earning:

- **1st place in 2025**  
- **3rd place in 2024**

This blog is my personal archive of things I find interesting:

- HTB writeups  
- Linux tutorials  
- Red teaming tactics  
- Penetration testing techniques

I hope you find something useful or interesting here!
